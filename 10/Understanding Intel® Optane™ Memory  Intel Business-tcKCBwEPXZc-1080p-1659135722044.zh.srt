1
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:06,454
了解Intel 傲腾内存就和做煎饼一样容易
understanding Intel Optane memory is as easy as well making pancakes

2
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:07,812
不相信我们？
don't believe us?

3
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:13,684
先把你电脑中的数据想象成摊煎饼的原材料
start by thinking of the data your computer uses as the ingredients you need to make pancakes

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,803
把计算机处理器想象成厨子
imagine the computers processor as the cook

5
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,395
DRAM 则作为厨房台面
and the DRAM as the kitchen countertops

6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,890
硬盘则是出售原料的商店
the store that sells all these ingredients is the hard drive and

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,039
并且它是个隔了好几里地的超级大商店
it's a mega store two towns away to get

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,060
厨子必须开车到商店去，才能带回原材料
the ingredients the cook has to drive to the store and bring the ingredients back

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,290
同时把需要的材料放到台面上，每次都需要做很多工作
to the countertop where they are needed to cook that's a lot of work every time

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,975
真是非常费事呢！
you want to make pancakes

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:42,059
现在，如果想要加速这个过程就意味着要增加更多的 DRAM 或者说是计算空间
until now speeding up this process has usually meant adding more DRAM or counter space

12
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,170
但这既昂贵又不切实际
that is both expensive and unrealistic

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,911
即使有一个更大更贵台面，你仍然需要去商店才能购买原材料
even with a larger expensive countertop you still need to get all those ingredients from the store

14
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,191
这就是Intel派上用场的地方
that's where Intel comes in

15
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:58,617
Intel 傲腾内存位于机械硬盘和处理器之间
Intel Optane memory sits between your hard drive and your processor

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:02,727
它有点像厨房边的一个方便的储藏室
kind of like a big convenient pantry right next to your kitchen

17
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:06,493
Intel 傲腾内存也能被用作系统加速器
Intel Optane memory also used as the system accelerator driver

18
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:11,108
我们叫这块加速器为“副厨师长”吧！你的副厨会为主厨准备好一切
let's call this driver your sous chef the sous chef gets everything ready for the cook

19
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:15,352
经过一段时间的相处，你的副厨知道你每周六早上都做煎饼
over time your sous chef learns that you make pancakes every Saturday morning

20
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:16,747
真棒！！
good for you

21
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:22,830
你那位出色的副厨会准备好你需要的食材，并将它们贮存在储藏室中
to prepare our awesome sous chef gets the ingredients you need from the store and keeps them in the pantry so

22
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,978
系统加速器会自动学习你的计算行为
the system accelerator automatically learns your computing behaviors

23
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:31,961
智能识别你最常访问的文件和数据来进行加速
and accelerates frequent tasks by intelligently identifying the files and data you access most frequently

24
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,403
并把它们存储在Intel 傲腾内存模块中
and storing them in the intel Optane memory module

25
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:36,975
谢谢厨师
Thank You chef

26
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:41,487
现在你所需的原料或者说数据就在旁边的储藏室里
now you have all the ingredients or data right where you need it in your pantry

27
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,532
因此，你不用再去商店跑一趟了
so no more trips to the store

28
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:47,424
也就是说，它成为了一台速度更快、响应更敏捷、没有短板的PC
it's a faster more responsive PC with no lag

29
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:52,314
Intel 傲腾内存可以加速任何一颗第七代酷睿处理器赋能的系统
Intel Optane memory will accelerate any seventh gen core processor based system

30
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:54,914
在哪里可以得到Intel 傲腾内存加持的体验呢？
how do you get Intel Optane memory

31
00:01:55,001 --> 00:02:00,200
可以在支持傲腾技术的主板或准系统中安装
install the Intel Optane memory module in an Intel obtain ready motherboard or system

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,075
或者，你也可以直接从当地的零售商处购买带有 Intel 傲腾内存的整机 
or purchase a complete system with Intel Optane memory already installed from a  local retailer

33
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,327
有了它，你就可以在厨房里呼风唤雨
so you can be a beast in the kitchen and achieve dramatically better performance

34
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,759
意味着你的大容量存储介质能获得更好的性能
with all the storage capacity you need

35
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:16,696
换句话说，你可以好好地吃你的煎饼了！
in other words you can / have your pancakes and eat them too

36
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:20,210
