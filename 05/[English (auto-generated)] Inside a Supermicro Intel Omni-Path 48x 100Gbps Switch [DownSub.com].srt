[Music]

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,650
嘿嘿，这里是STH的Patrick
hey guys this is Patrick from STH

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,315
今天我们来看看这台来自超微的Intel OPA 48口100G交换机的内部 
today we're to look inside a super micro intel omni path 48 port a handred gigabit per second switch

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,130
OPA是一个非常有意思的技术，我们会做一系列的视频
now this is a really interesting technology in this part of our series that we're gonna start doing

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,350
看看这些不太一样的服务器硬件
taking a look at various server hardware

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,480
虽然它们有些没有被广泛应用，但其中也有一些不错的创新技术 
platforms that you know really showed a lot of innovation maybe they didn't get a great adoption or maybe they did but

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,210
我们只是想给各位看一些在实验室里的有趣的东西
we just kind of wanted to show people some of the things that are in the lab

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,250
你们平常可能看不到这样的硬件
that are really cool pieces of hardware that you wouldn't normally see otherwise

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,570
好的，让我们来看看Intel Omni Path(OPA)
okay so Intel Omni path so Omni path that was

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:52,138
OPA最低就是100Gbps光纤，以此来和Mellanox主导的InfiniBand还有以太网在高性能计算领域竞争 
started as a 100 gate per second fabric to really compete with both InfiniBand which Mellanox was championing as well as Ethernet in the high performance computing space

11
00:00:52,162 --> 00:01:00,059
它有两种部署模式，第一种是标准的PCI-E 3.0x16形式拓展卡
and they're really two ways of this was deployed the first way was on a standard PCIe by 16 gen 3 card

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,909
看起来和以太网网卡还有Mellanox IB卡没什么两样的
and now it looks a lot like an Ethernet NIC or a Mellanox InfiniBand adapter but

13
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,044
另一种方法我觉得更好玩一些，我们之前在实验室就见过这样的
the other way I think was a lot more interesting and it's something that we actually saw in the lab

14
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:17,939
为了让大家给OPA捧场，Intel把OPA光纤网卡集成到了
to get adoption for Omni path Intel actually integrated the Omni path fabric adapter directly on

15
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,770
Xeon phi 的Knight landing以及Knight mill两条产品线里
to chip packages both in the Xeon Phi Knights landing in Knights mil but also

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:31,259
以及cascade lake 的前任，至强可拓展或者叫他skylake
 in cascade lake predecessor which was the Intel Xeon scalable SP or skylake

17
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:40,590
只要多花$155，100G光纤抱回家 
and so for about $155 more than these standards SKU you could get a hundred gig fabric connector built in and with

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:48,509
而且还不用为了网卡多花16条PCI-E通道
that also meant was that you didn't have to use PCIe lanes for your hundred gig fabric which takes 16 you could just use

19
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,550
因为它用的是Intel专属PCI-E通达 
this because their dedicated PCIe lanes on the package

20
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,220
性价比不错吧
 that was awesome and the

21
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:02,790
Intel也觉得在基础配置上，比如6148上，加$155就能都得到一个集成的网卡真是太划算了
fact that Intel was selling them basically the on package adapters for only like $155 uplift to over a normal SKU like a 6148 that's a big deal

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,571
如果一个组织能采用OPA的话，成本能节约很多
because it became a lot cheaper for organizations to use omni path than other fabrics

23
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:18,360
实际上呢，这个技术用的人还是比较少，很多服务器也不能把这根线从CPU引出到机箱后面 
in practice it was still always a little bit funky to use and a lot of server couldn't even get the little cables that would connect from the CPUs to the back of chassis and that was kind

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,209
整体的体验上并不是特别好
of a weird little bit from the whole experience but we also didn't see the

25
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,489
Intel也看到了，于是OPA并没有在Intel的cascade lake中出现
Omni path make it into cascade lake so it seems like Intel's doing a reset for

26
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,829
Intel似乎要重置OPA 200系列了
OPA 200 they announced a little bit at

27
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:39,569
他们在SC18中宣布了这件事，但目前还没有任何消息
supercomputing 18 but we're not really seeing a ton of it now so we hope to see it in the future instead or we're gonna

28
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:47,909
不管那么多了，我们今天要看的是超微出品的Intel OPA 48口100G交换机
do today is it we're gonna go look at an Intel Omni Path 48
port hundred gigabit per second switch that Super Micro made

29
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,109
虽然是超微生产的，但大部分设计都参照了Intel的参考设计
but a lot of these designs were mostly the Intel reference design that were

30
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,780
或者说Intel只是和合作伙伴一起，做出了这个产品
just produced by their partners okay so

31
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,500
我们先来看产品吧
let's go look at it the actual model that we're looking at is a Super Micro

32
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,230
它的名字是超微SSH-C48Q
SSH-C48Q you can see that there are

33
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,409
你能看到前面板有48个QSFP28接口
48 QSFP28 ports on the front and this

34
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,159
这个QSFP28物理接口和IB和以太网的接口是一样的 
is the same q SS p 28 connector that you use for InfiniBand or Ethernet there's

35
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,690
另外还有管理口和USB口
also managed port USB port

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,810
接着我们来打开这台交换机看看内部，这才是好戏对吧
but now let's open up the switch and see what's inside because we want to see kind of the cool bits of the switch so

37
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,269
拧开背后的螺丝，抬起盖子
we're gonna just open up the thumb screw on the back and lift the cover off this

38
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,504
这算是个比较好拆的交换机了 
is actually a really easy switch to get open

39
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:30,359
内部...很简洁...或者说简陋
and inside you can see something that's well pretty darn simple sometimes

40
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:37,889
一般实验室里的初版都非常复杂，非常粗糙
when we get things in the lab they are very complex and they look like pretty rough first versions but this is

41
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,599
但这台看上去非常简洁，只有几个组件
actually a really clean design that only has a few major components since we're

42
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,209
既然我们在交换机的后方，那就先从风扇开始介绍吧 
starting at the rear of the chassis I guess it kind of makes sense to look at the fans first and you can see that

43
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,209
这些风扇就是标准的4pin 1u风扇
these are just standard 1u fans they're actually used a four pin pwm power

44
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,000
你在标准的白盒交换机里面都能看到
connector which is standard you need to see that in most white box servers and

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,569
这些风扇不是真的热插拔风扇，但也不像普通1u服务器那样
they're not really hot-swap but that's also not overly
common in 1u servers and instead what they have is

46
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:13,349
他们用这些延长线连接风扇，如果你想更换风扇，从中间就可以断开排线
they have these long extension cables and long extension cables bring power
to each fan and you can snap them in the middle too if you had to replace them

47
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,440
这里是冗余的750w电源
there's also a redundant power supplies this using 750 watt redundant power

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,500
这是电源分配板
supplies and there's a power distribution board for those power

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:32,330
以上是交换机的电源和冷却部分
supplies and that's pretty much the cooling and power that's needed for this entire switch which is really not that much

50
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,130
相比于如今的高端200G或者400G交换机，这个配置不算豪华
compared to some of the higher-end 200 400 gig switches that we're seeing these

51
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:45,889
在这个散热器底下压着交换机是ASIC芯片
days under this big heat sink that's the main switch ASIC for the platform it

52
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,380
它需要消耗大量电力，这就是为什么需要高端的冗余电源 
uses a lot of power so that's why we have redundant power we also have pretty high end power supplies you also

53
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,760
还有这里的Molex QSFP28 母口插座
see these molex QSFP28 cages each cage

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,230
每个插座都有六个QSFP28接口
has a total of six QSFP28 connectors

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:07,940
8 * 6 = 48 (port)
and there are eight six port connectors so that or cages so that means that gives you 48 ports and in the back we

56
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,195
还有一个有意思的东西是这个小卡 
have something that's I think a little bit interesting as well which is this little card

57
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:19,970
这张卡是管理卡，在很多高端交换机上都有出现 
now this little card is something that we see on pretty high end switches and it's a management card so

58
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,340
如果你把它拿下来就能看到上面有CPU、内存
if we actually take the card out you'll see as you see there's a CPU on the area see that there's memory on there and in

59
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:33,410
在高端交换机里面很多都有一整台电脑运行在里面
higher end switches they actually have entire computers that run inside the switch that do all the management

60
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,890
用来提供管理功能
functions that you would need beyond

61
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,050
而速度超快的ASIC只需要移动数据就行了
just you know the superfast switch ASIC moving data around so this is kind of

62
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,671
这就是交换机的控制面了
cool just to see the control plane of the switch

63
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:50,479
当我们把这台交换机装在实验室里运行NVMEoF的时候
when this switch was installed in our lab that was running a NVME over fabric we even had an optain nvme

64
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,187
插一嘴，我们在实验室里用傲腾搭建了一个NVMEoF演示场景
over fabric demo setup with it

65
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,161
它运行的很好
it worked really well

66
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,140
因为这东西你平常应该不太能见到
and it's something you don't

67
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,380
所以我就拿它作为我们“牛逼的硬件”系列的开端了
really see a lot so we wanted to bring this as the start to our cool hardware series that we're gonna be doing on sth

68
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,690
